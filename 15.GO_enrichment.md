Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis
================

In a previous analysis (see [14.ehh\_pbs](14.ehh_pbs.md) we identified a
total of 155 genes that overlapped with 58 regions identified as being
in the top 1% of EHH stats and also as having significant PBS values. A
summary of sweep regions and the number of genes covered by them in each
population is shown below;

| pop           | numgenes | nregions |
|:--------------|---------:|---------:|
| inshore       |       99 |       27 |
| northoffshore |       15 |       12 |
| southoffshore |       41 |       20 |

We used `topGO` to test whether any GO terms were enriched in the gene
sets covered by selective sweeps in each population. Enrichment was
initially calculated in a gene-centric manner because GO terms are most
properly interpreted as attached to genes not regions. This initial
(naive) enrichment calculation identified several significantly enriched
GO terms, however, as can be seen in the table below these were almost
always supported by just a single region.
