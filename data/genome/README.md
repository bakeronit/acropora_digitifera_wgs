We used version 2.0 of the Acropora digitifera genome.

# Assembled Sequences

A version of the assembled sequence for this genome is available under NCBI accession `GCA_014634065.1` but at the time of writing had not yet undergone NCBI's annotation pipeline for incorporation into RefSeq. 

Another version is available from [OIST](https://marinegenomics.oist.jp/adig/viewer/download?project_id=87) and this one does have gene annotations.



We obtained the Gene models for this genome from Chuya Shinzato (in file `Adig-2.0.gff` and used a translation table to assign the scaffold IDs in this file to those used in the NCBI assembly.)  This resulted in file `Adig-2.0-ncbinames.gff`
