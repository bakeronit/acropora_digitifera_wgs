  abstract = "The metaphor of 'genomic islands of speciation' was first used to
              describe heterogeneous differentiation among loci between the
              genomes of closely related species. The biological model proposed
              to explain these differences was that the regions showing high
              levels of differentiation were resistant to gene flow between
              species, while the remainder of the genome was being homogenized
              by gene flow and consequently showed lower levels of
              differentiation. However, the conditions under which such
              differentiation can occur at multiple unlinked loci are
              restrictive; additionally, essentially, all previous analyses
              have been carried out using relative measures of divergence,
              which can be misleading when regions with different levels of
              recombination are compared. Here, we test the model of
              differential gene flow by asking whether absolute divergence is
              also higher in the previously identified 'islands'. Using five
              species pairs for which full sequence data are available, we find
              that absolute measures of divergence are not higher in genomic
              islands. Instead, in all cases examined, we find reduced
              diversity in these regions, a consequence of which is that
              relative measures of divergence are abnormally high. These data
              therefore do not support a model of differential gene flow among
              loci, although islands of relative divergence may represent loci
              involved in local adaptation. Simulations using the program IMa2
              further suggest that inferences of any gene flow may be incorrect
              in many comparisons. We instead present an alternative
              explanation for heterogeneous patterns of differentiation, one in
              which postspeciation selection generates patterns consistent with
              multiple aspects of the data.",

  abstract = "The African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (A.
              gambiae), provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of
              reproductive isolation because it is divided into two sympatric,
              partially isolated subtaxa known as M form and S form. With the
              annotated genome of this species now available, high-throughput
              techniques can be applied to locate and characterize the genomic
              regions contributing to reproductive isolation. In order to
              quantify patterns of differentiation within A. gambiae, we
              hybridized population samples of genomic DNA from each form to
              Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. We found that three regions,
              together encompassing less than 2.8 Mb, are the only locations
              where the M and S forms are significantly differentiated. Two of
              these regions are adjacent to centromeres, on Chromosomes 2L and
              X, and contain 50 and 12 predicted genes, respectively. Sequenced
              loci in these regions contain fixed differences between forms and
              no shared polymorphisms, while no fixed differences were found at
              nearby control loci. The third region, on Chromosome 2R, contains
              only five predicted genes; fixed differences in this region were
              also verified by direct sequencing. These ``speciation islands''
              remain differentiated despite considerable gene flow, and are
              therefore expected to contain the genes responsible for
              reproductive isolation. Much effort has recently been applied to
              locating the genes and genetic changes responsible for
              reproductive isolation between species. Though much can be
              inferred about speciation by studying taxa that have diverged for
              millions of years, studying differentiation between taxa that are
              in the early stages of isolation will lead to a clearer view of
              the number and size of regions involved in the genetics of
              speciation. Despite appreciable levels of gene flow between the M
              and S forms of A. gambiae, we were able to isolate three small
              regions of differentiation where genes responsible for ecological
              and behavioral isolation are likely to be located. We expect
              reproductive isolation to be due to changes at a small number of
              loci, as these regions together contain only 67 predicted genes.
              Concentrating future mapping experiments on these regions should
              reveal the genes responsible for reproductive isolation between
              forms.",

  abstract = "It is known that the allele ancestral to the variation at a
              polymorphic site cannot be assigned with certainty, and that the
              most frequently used method to assign the ancestral state-maximum
              parsimony-is prone to misinference. Estimates of counts of sites
              that have a certain number of copies of the derived allele in a
              sample (the unfolded site frequency spectrum, uSFS) made by
              parsimony are therefore also biased. We previously developed a
              maximum likelihood method to estimate the uSFS for a focal
              species using information from two outgroups while assuming
              simple models of nucleotide substitution. Here, we extend this
              approach to allow multiple outgroups (implemented for three
              outgroups), potentially any phylogenetic tree topology, and more
              complex models of nucleotide substitution. We find, however, that
              two outgroups and the Kimura two-parameter model are adequate for
              uSFS inference in most cases. We show that using parsimony to
              infer the ancestral state at a specific site seriously breaks
              down in two situations. The first is where the outgroups provide
              no information about the ancestral state of variation in the
              focal species. In this case, nucleotide variation will be
              underestimated if such sites are excluded. The second is where
              the minor allele in the focal species agrees with the allelic
              state of the outgroups. In this situation, parsimony tends to
              overestimate the probability of the major allele being derived,
              because it fails to account for the fact that sites with a high
              frequency of the derived allele tend to be rare. We present a
              method that corrects this deficiency and is capable of providing
              nearly unbiased estimates of ancestral state probabilities on a
              site-by-site basis and the uSFS.",

Modern Indo-Pacific reefs are dominated by species of the staghorn coral genus Acropora, but the evolutionary and ecological factors associated with their diversification and rise to dominance are unclear. Recent work on evolutionary radiations has demonstrated the importance of introgression and ecological opportunity in promoting diversification and ecological success. Here, we analyze the genomes of five staghorn coral species to examine the roles of introgression and ecological opportunity in the rise to dominance of Acropora. We found evidence for a history marked by a major introgression event as well as recurrent gene flow across species. In addition, we found that genes with topologies mismatching the species tree are evolving faster, which is suggestive of a role for introgression in spreading adaptive genetic variation. Demographic analysis showed that Acropora lineages profited from climate-driven mass extinctions in the Plio-Pleistocene, indicating that Acropora exploited ecological opportunity opened by a new climatic regime favoring species that could cope with rapid sea-level changes. Collectively, the genomes of reef-building corals have recorded an evolutionary history shaped by introgression and climate change, suggesting that Acropora—among most vulnerable corals to stressors—may be critical for understanding how reefs track the impending rapid sea-level changes of the Anthropocene.}},

              the ``complex'' (Acroporidae, Agariciidae) and ``robust''
              (Fungiidae) clades. Focused sampling in the staghorn corals
              (genus Acropora) highlights the ability of sequence capture to
              inform the taxonomy of a clade previously deficient in molecular
              resolution. A mean of 1850 ($\pm$298) loci were captured per
              taxon (955 UCEs, 894 exons), and a 75\% complete concatenated
              alignment of 96 samples included 1792 loci (991 UCE, 801 exons)

              analyses recovered robust molecular relationships and revealed
              that species-level relationships within the Acropora are

  abstract = "The haplotypes of a beneficial allele carry information about its
              history that can shed light on its age and the putative cause for
              its increase in frequency. Specifically, the signature of an
              allele's age is contained in the pattern of variation that
              mutation and recombination impose on its haplotypic background.
              We provide a method to exploit this pattern and infer the time to
              the common ancestor of a positively selected allele following a
              rapid increase in frequency. We do so using a hidden Markov model
              which leverages the length distribution of the shared ancestral
              haplotype, the accumulation of derived mutations on the ancestral
              background, and the surrounding background haplotype diversity.
              Using simulations, we demonstrate how the inclusion of
              information from both mutation and recombination events increases
              accuracy relative to approaches that only consider a single type
              of event. We also show the behavior of the estimator in cases
              where data do not conform to model assumptions, and provide some
              diagnostics for assessing and improving inference. Using the
              method, we analyze population-specific patterns in the 1000

We report here on a genome-wide scan for signals of very recent positive selection in favor of variants that have not yet reached fixation. We describe a new analytical method for scanning single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for signals of recent selection, and apply this to data from the International HapMap Project. In all three continental groups we find widespread signals of recent positive selection. Most signals are region-specific, though a significant excess are shared across groups. Contrary to some earlier low resolution studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest signals of selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest in mapping studies of complex traits. For this purpose we have developed a set of SNPs that can be used to tag the strongest ∼250 signals of recent selection in each population.",
