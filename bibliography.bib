              surrounding most of Okinawa island (OI) were devastated, although
              they are now gradually recovering. In contrast, the Kerama
              Islands (KIs) only 30 km west of OI, have continuously hosted a
              great variety of healthy corals. Taking advantage of the decoded
              Acropora digitifera genome and using genome-wide SNP analyses, we
              clarified Acropora population structure in the southern Ryukyu
              Archipelago (sRA). Despite small genetic distances, we identified
              distinct clusters corresponding to specific island groups,
              suggesting infrequent long-distance dispersal within the sRA.
              Although the KIs were believed to supply coral larvae to OI,
              admixture analyses showed that such dispersal is much more
              limited than previously realized, indicating independent recovery
              of OI coral populations and the necessity of local conservation
              efforts for each region. We detected strong historical migration
              from the Yaeyama Islands (YIs) to OI, and suggest that the YIs
              are the original source of OI corals. In addition, migration
              edges to the KIs suggest that they are a historical sink

Modern Indo-Pacific reefs are dominated by species of the staghorn coral genus Acropora, but the evolutionary and ecological factors associated with their diversification and rise to dominance are unclear. Recent work on evolutionary radiations has demonstrated the importance of introgression and ecological opportunity in promoting diversification and ecological success. Here, we analyze the genomes of five staghorn coral species to examine the roles of introgression and ecological opportunity in the rise to dominance of Acropora. We found evidence for a history marked by a major introgression event as well as recurrent gene flow across species. In addition, we found that genes with topologies mismatching the species tree are evolving faster, which is suggestive of a role for introgression in spreading adaptive genetic variation. Demographic analysis showed that Acropora lineages profited from climate-driven mass extinctions in the Plio-Pleistocene, indicating that Acropora exploited ecological opportunity opened by a new climatic regime favoring species that could cope with rapid sea-level changes. Collectively, the genomes of reef-building corals have recorded an evolutionary history shaped by introgression and climate change, suggesting that Acropora—among most vulnerable corals to stressors—may be critical for understanding how reefs track the impending rapid sea-level changes of the Anthropocene.}},

              allele's age is contained in the pattern of variation that
              mutation and recombination impose on its haplotypic background.
              We provide a method to exploit this pattern and infer the time to
              the common ancestor of a positively selected allele following a
              rapid increase in frequency. We do so using a hidden Markov model

              haplotype, the accumulation of derived mutations on the ancestral
              background, and the surrounding background haplotype diversity.
              Using simulations, we demonstrate how the inclusion of
              information from both mutation and recombination events increases
              accuracy relative to approaches that only consider a single type
