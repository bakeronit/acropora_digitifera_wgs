  abstract = "Following a global coral bleaching event in 1998, Acropora corals
              surrounding most of Okinawa island (OI) were devastated, although
              they are now gradually recovering. In contrast, the Kerama
              Islands (KIs) only 30 km west of OI, have continuously hosted a
              great variety of healthy corals. Taking advantage of the decoded
              Acropora digitifera genome and using genome-wide SNP analyses, we
              clarified Acropora population structure in the southern Ryukyu
              Archipelago (sRA). Despite small genetic distances, we identified
              distinct clusters corresponding to specific island groups,
              suggesting infrequent long-distance dispersal within the sRA.
              Although the KIs were believed to supply coral larvae to OI,
              admixture analyses showed that such dispersal is much more
              limited than previously realized, indicating independent recovery
              of OI coral populations and the necessity of local conservation
              efforts for each region. We detected strong historical migration
              from the Yaeyama Islands (YIs) to OI, and suggest that the YIs
              are the original source of OI corals. In addition, migration
              edges to the KIs suggest that they are a historical sink
              population in the sRA, resulting in high diversity. This
              population genomics study provides the highest resolution data to
              date regarding coral population structure and history.",

abstract = {{Reef-building corals provide the structural basis for one of Earth’s most spectacular and diverse—but increasingly threatened—ecosystems. Modern Indo-Pacific reefs are dominated by species of the staghorn coral genus Acropora, but the evolutionary and ecological factors associated with their diversification and rise to dominance are unclear. Recent work on evolutionary radiations has demonstrated the importance of introgression and ecological opportunity in promoting diversification and ecological success. Here, we analyze the genomes of five staghorn coral species to examine the roles of introgression and ecological opportunity in the rise to dominance of Acropora. We found evidence for a history marked by a major introgression event as well as recurrent gene flow across species. In addition, we found that genes with topologies mismatching the species tree are evolving faster, which is suggestive of a role for introgression in spreading adaptive genetic variation. Demographic analysis showed that Acropora lineages profited from climate-driven mass extinctions in the Plio-Pleistocene, indicating that Acropora exploited ecological opportunity opened by a new climatic regime favoring species that could cope with rapid sea-level changes. Collectively, the genomes of reef-building corals have recorded an evolutionary history shaped by introgression and climate change, suggesting that Acropora—among most vulnerable corals to stressors—may be critical for understanding how reefs track the impending rapid sea-level changes of the Anthropocene.}},

              redesign a custom bait set previously developed for the cnidarian
              class Anthozoa to more efficiently target and capture
              ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and exonic loci within the
              subclass Hexacorallia. We test this enhanced bait set (targeting
              2476 loci) on 99 specimens of scleractinian corals spanning both
              the ``complex'' (Acroporidae, Agariciidae) and ``robust''
              (Fungiidae) clades. Focused sampling in the staghorn corals
              (genus Acropora) highlights the ability of sequence capture to
              inform the taxonomy of a clade previously deficient in molecular
              resolution. A mean of 1850 ($\pm$298) loci were captured per
              taxon (955 UCEs, 894 exons), and a 75\% complete concatenated
              alignment of 96 samples included 1792 loci (991 UCE, 801 exons)
              and ~1.87 million base pairs. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian
              analyses recovered robust molecular relationships and revealed
              that species-level relationships within the Acropora are
              incongruent with traditional morphological groupings. Both UCE
              and exon datasets delineated six well-supported clades within
              Acropora. The enhanced bait set will facilitate investigations of
              the evolutionary history of many important groups of reef corals,
