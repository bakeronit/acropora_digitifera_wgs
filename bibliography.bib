  abstract = "Following a global coral bleaching event in 1998, Acropora corals
              surrounding most of Okinawa island (OI) were devastated, although
              they are now gradually recovering. In contrast, the Kerama
              Islands (KIs) only 30 km west of OI, have continuously hosted a
              great variety of healthy corals. Taking advantage of the decoded
              Acropora digitifera genome and using genome-wide SNP analyses, we
              clarified Acropora population structure in the southern Ryukyu
              Archipelago (sRA). Despite small genetic distances, we identified
              distinct clusters corresponding to specific island groups,
              suggesting infrequent long-distance dispersal within the sRA.
              Although the KIs were believed to supply coral larvae to OI,
              admixture analyses showed that such dispersal is much more
              limited than previously realized, indicating independent recovery
              of OI coral populations and the necessity of local conservation
              efforts for each region. We detected strong historical migration
              from the Yaeyama Islands (YIs) to OI, and suggest that the YIs
              are the original source of OI corals. In addition, migration
              edges to the KIs suggest that they are a historical sink
              population in the sRA, resulting in high diversity. This
              population genomics study provides the highest resolution data to
              date regarding coral population structure and history.",
