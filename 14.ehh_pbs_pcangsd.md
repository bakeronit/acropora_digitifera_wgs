Analysis of genetic statistics (pbs, Tajima’s D, pi) in EHH sweep
regions
================

Regions identified as sweeps via EHH statistics also tended to have more
extreme values of the population branch statistic (PBS), explained more
genetic variation related to population structure (PCAdapt statistic),
and had elevated values of Tajima’s D.
